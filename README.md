This is a rendition of the classic Battleship game by Hasbro. In this version you can play locally human v human OR vs an AI CPU of 2 difficulties, Easy and Normal

Easy AI: picks random coordinates no matter what
Normal AI: tries positions adjacent if it lands a hit, and if there are 2 hits, continues attacking in a line until a miss is registered.

Human v Human: General Loop:

player 1 places their ships, the board then changes for player 2 to place their ships.
Take turns attacking alternating the gameboard so the opponeent cannot see th location of their opponeents ships.

Display idea:
Display current players small and in the corner. Display the opponents (hidden) board larger and center frame.

Learned:
